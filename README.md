# Turbo3D: KJ66 Jet Engine Design

## Overview
Welcome to the **Turbo3D** project! This repository contains detailed 3D models of the KJ66 jet turbine engine, including all the key components and parts involved in the engine's design and assembly. Alongside the 3D designs, you'll find PDFs and presentations that explain the working of the engine and the concepts behind its construction.

## Repository Contents

### 1. **3D Models**
This folder contains the 3D models for the KJ66 engine. Each part of the engine is designed with precision and can be explored individually. The parts available in this repository include:
- **Compressor**
- **Turbine**
- **Shaft**
- **Inner Chamber** (and many more)

**File Formats:**
- `.stl`
- `.step`

You can view and manipulate these models using any 3D modeling software such as Blender, Fusion 360, or any other viewer of your choice.

### 2. **Documents**
This folder contains resources that explain the working of the KJ66 jet turbine engine:
- **PDFs**: Detailed technical documents that describe each part of the engine and its function.
- **Presentations**: Slide decks that provide an overview of the turbine's concepts, the engineering behind it, and the simulations conducted.

### 3. **Simulations**
Simulation files demonstrating airflow, pressure, and temperature distributions across various components of the KJ66 engine. These simulations offer insights into the engine's performance and behavior under different operating conditions.

### 4. **Images**
A collection of rendered images of the 3D models, showcasing different views of the assembled engine as well as individual parts.

## How to Use
To explore the 3D models:
1. Download the `.stl` or `.step` files from the [3D_Models](./3D_Models) directory.
2. Open them in your preferred 3D modeling or CAD software.


### Key Points:
- **3D Models**: Explains where to find and how to use the 3D files.
- **Documents & Presentations**: Highlights the technical documents and concepts.
- **Simulations**: Describes any performance simulations included.
